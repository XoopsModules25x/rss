Notes for upgrading from version 1.0x: There is no upgrade patch since over 90 percent of the files are modified. You have to replace the entire directory contents with the new version. Don't forget to update the module after uploading new files. If you have the rss feed smarty template customized you should take a look at the file templates/rssfit_rss.html for corresponding changes.
